> ... No psychologist or augur will be in doubt for a moment as to what stage of the `development` just described the following book belongs (or is assigned to). But where are these psychologists nowadays? In France, certainly; perhaps in Russia; assuredly not in Germany. Reasons are not lacking why the present-day Germans could still even count this as an honour to them—bad enough, surely, for one who in this respect is un-German in disposition and constitution! This German book, which has been able to find readers in a `wide circle of countries and nations`—it has been about ten years going its rounds—and `must understand some sort of music and piping art`, by means of which even coy `foreign ears are seduced into listening`,—it is precisely in Germany that this book has been most negligently read, and worst listened to; what is the reason?" It demands too much, "I have been told," it appeals to men free from the pressure of coarse duties, it wants refined and fastidious senses, it needs superfluity—superfluity of time, of clearness of sky and heart, of otium in the boldest sense of the term:—purely good things, which we Germans of to-day do not possess and therefore cannot give." After such a polite answer my philosophy advises me to be silent and not to question further; besides, in certain cases, as the proverb points out, one only remains a philosopher by being—silent.

Friedrich Nietzsche originally published "Human, All Too Human: A Book for Free Spirits" in 1878. However, the [preface](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/51935/pg51935-images.html#INTRODUCTION) to the second edition, which often captures significant attention for its insights into his evolving philosophy, was written several years later, in 1886. This was a pivotal period in Nietzsche's intellectual development, marking a transition from his early influences, notably his break with Wagner and his growing skepticism towards traditional morality and metaphysics.

This gap of about eight years between the original publication and the preface to the second edition is noteworthy. It reflects Nietzsche's deepening engagement with themes of skepticism, individualism, and the critique of morality, which would come to define much of his later work. The period allowed Nietzsche to refine his thoughts and approach, making the preface not just an introduction but a critical reflection on his philosophical journey and the evolution of his ideas.

Nietzsche's decision to add a preface years after the initial publication is an example of his ongoing process of self-examination and reevaluation. It underscores his commitment to a philosophy that is alive, questioning, and in a state of becoming, rather than a set of fixed doctrines. This approach is emblematic of Nietzsche's broader philosophical stance, emphasizing the importance of personal transformation and the revaluation of values as central to human experience.
