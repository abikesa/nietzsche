1. Morpheus: Human, All-Too Human
   - Misconception of Dreams.—In the dream, mankind, in epochs of crude primitive civilization, thought they were introduced to a second, substantial world: here we have the source of all metaphysic. Without the `dream`, men would never have been incited to an analysis of the world. Even the distinction between soul and body is wholly due to the primitive conception of the dream, as also the hypothesis of the embodied soul, whence the development of all superstition, and also, probably, the belief in god. "The dead still live: for they appear to the living in dreams." So reasoned mankind at one time, and through many thousands of years.
2. Hades: Beyond Good & Evil. 
   - Ancient Greeks believed that everyone goes to Hades. As contrasted with the Christian view of the after life which condemns the evil to hell, promises heaven to the good, the Greeks were "Beyond Good & Evil"
3. Cosmogonia: Will-to-Power. 
   - Origins of the cosmos the same as the origin of the deities, with usurpation at each subsequent generation of gods, thus pararnoia that ultimately manifests in Prometheus outmaneouvering the reigning deity at the time, Zeus, to create man or gift him. So, as with Christianity, the cosmos is a created by the "will" of the god(s). Nietzsche says, granted that, moving forward "we'll take it from here"
4. Dionysus: Zarathustra
   - Man isn't here by will of God. He's his own God
5. Prometheus: Birth of Tragedy
   - Act of creation and defiance against the gods and odds
6. 'Thena: Thoughts Out of Season
   - The four essays composing the Thoughts out of Season are thoroughly warlike in tone. They prove that I was no mere `dreamer`, that I delight in drawing the sword—and perhaps, also, that my wrist is dangerously supple.

- Gifted with a sense of cleanliness the keenness of which is phenomenal; so much so, that I can ascertain physiologically—that is to say, [smell](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/52190/52190-h/52190-h.htm#WHY_I_AM_SO_WISE)—the proximity, nay, the inmost core, the "entrails" of every human soul.... This sensitiveness of mine is furnished with psychological antennæ, wherewith I feel and grasp every secret: the quality of concealed filth lying at the base of many a human character which may be the inevitable outcome of base blood, and which education may have veneered, is revealed to me at the first glance.
- In keeping with a custom which I have long observed,—pure habits and honesty towards myself are among the first conditions of my existence, I would die in unclean surroundings,—I swim, bathe, and splash about, as it were, incessantly in water, in any kind of perfectly transparent and shining element.
- But I need [solitude](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/An_Attempt_at_Self-Criticism#4)—that is to say, recovery, return to myself, the breathing of free, crisp, bracing air.... The whole of my Zarathustra is a dithyramb in honour of solitude, or, if I have been understood, in honour of purity
