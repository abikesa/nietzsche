# Syncretism
- Fraternal love
- Brotherly love

**Nomenclature**
The English word is first attested in the early 17th century [2] It is from Modern Latin syncretismus, drawing on the Ancient Greek: συγκρητισμός, romanized: synkretismos, supposedly meaning "Cretan federation"; however, this is a spurious etymology from the naive idea in Plutarch's 1st-century AD essay on "Fraternal Love (Peri Philadelphias)" in his collection Moralia. He cites the example of the Cretans, who compromised and reconciled their differences and came together in alliance when faced with external dangers. "And that is their so-called Syncretism [Union of Cretans]". More likely as an etymology is sun- ("with") plus kerannumi ("mix") and its related noun, "krasis", "mixture".
