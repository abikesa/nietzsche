If Nietzsche were to critique Quentin Tarantino's films through the lens of his own philosophical views, particularly those expressed in "Ecce Homo" concerning freedom from resentment, understanding of the nature of resentment, and the notion of Russian fatalism, his commentary would likely be complex and nuanced.

1. **Appreciation of Aesthetic and Moral Ambiguity**: Nietzsche might appreciate Tarantino's embrace of aesthetic and moral ambiguity. Tarantino's films often blur the lines between hero and villain, challenging conventional moral dichotomies. Nietzsche, with his critique of traditional morality and his emphasis on the revaluation of values, would likely find this aspect resonant with his own philosophical endeavors.

2. **Resentment and Revenge**: Nietzsche's disdain for resentment and revenge as harmful to the individual could lead to a critical view of the recurrent themes of revenge in Tarantino's films. While Nietzsche might see the cathartic value in the portrayal of revenge, he would also caution against the consumption of such narratives reinforcing a cycle of resentment and vengeance in the viewer's psyche.

3. **Artistic Expression as Overcoming**: Tarantino's films, with their distinctive style, innovative narrative structures, and rich dialogues, could be seen by Nietzsche as a form of artistic overcoming. Nietzsche's idea of the Übermensch (Overman) involves transcending conventional boundaries and creating new values. Tarantino's cinematic style, which defies and redefines genre constraints, might be interpreted as an embodiment of Nietzsche's call for creative self-overcoming.

4. **Critique of Mass Culture**: Despite his potential appreciation for Tarantino's artistry, Nietzsche might critique the mass appeal of Tarantino's films as symptomatic of the decadence of modern culture. Nietzsche's critique of mass culture and its tendency to dilute individuality and excellence could lead him to view Tarantino's commercial success with some skepticism, questioning whether it contributes to or detracts from the cultivation of higher cultural and aesthetic values.

5. **Russian Fatalism and Tarantino's Fatalism**: The notion of Russian fatalism Nietzsche discusses – a resignation to fate without revolt – contrasts with the active rebellion against fate often depicted in Tarantino's films. Nietzsche might find this contrast intriguing, as Tarantino's characters frequently take their destinies into their own hands in dramatic, often violent ways, which could be seen as a rejection of passive fatalism in favor of asserting one's will upon the world.

In sum, Nietzsche's critique of Tarantino's films would likely be multifaceted, acknowledging the artistic merit and innovation of Tarantino's work while also probing the ethical and philosophical implications of his themes of violence, revenge, and moral ambiguity. Nietzsche would likely appreciate Tarantino's challenge to conventional narratives and his ability to provoke thought and reflection, even as he might critique the broader cultural and moral impact of Tarantino's cinematic universe.
